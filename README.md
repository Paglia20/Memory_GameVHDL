# Memory_GameVHDL

Plese note that waves and testbenches are outdated (i initially created them for memory1.0), hence might be useless for 2.0
You may notice two contributors on the repository, this is simply because I had to use two different computers to work on the project (since Vivado wasnâ€™t installed on my main one).
